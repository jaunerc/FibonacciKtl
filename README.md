This repo contains a simple project written in Kotlin. It is a personal introduction into the language. At the beginning there were several
things I wanted to explore.
1. Solve a simple problem in Kotlin
2. Test the software with unit tests
3. Build the software

In this readme I will show my solutions and how I found them.
